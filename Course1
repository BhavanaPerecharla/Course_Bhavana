HI,
This is Bhavana

From the module on cloning and open-source collaboration, I learned how to fork a repository to my own GitHub account and clone it to my local system using git clone. This allows me to contribute to open-source projects without affecting the original codebase. I also understood how to make changes, commit them, and create a pull request to propose updates. Overall, the module highlighted the importance of Git and GitHub in managing collaborative software development.
